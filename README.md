# Bank-Management-System
The principle of storing client account data underpins the Bank Management System. The user may accomplish all actions such as opening an account, depositing money, withdrawing money, checking balance, viewing all account holders' details, closing an account, and modifying an account here. This project does not have a login mechanism. This project includes all of the major aspects of a financial system.

**FUNCTIONS :**
In terms of the Bank Management System's functionality, a user may create an account by supplying the account holder's name, account number, amount type (Savings or Current account), and a starting amount. The user may then deposit and withdraw money simply by inputting his or her account information, letting the system show his or her profile, and entering a sum. He/she can also do a balance query, which reveals the account holder's name, account number type, and amount. He or she can also search for a list of all account holders. Another benefit is that the user may terminate their account by entering their account number and, if desired, change their account details and type.
